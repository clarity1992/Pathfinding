# Basic Pathfinding Implementation

## Goal
Constuct a basic pathfinder that will find a **Path** through a **Graph** for an **Agent**, using a simple integer path cost.
Performance is not a key concern, it is more about wrapping my head around *Basic* pathfinding.

## Extensions
* Implement different pathfinding algorithms (maybe construct report on performance differences etc.)
	- A*
	- BFS
	- DFS

* Add visual representation
